# About the course

## Course goals

Climate risk management is a very broad field.
We will:

1. **Survey** how it is implemented in different fields
1. Develop a **deep understanding** of how to assess proposed climate risk strategies
1. **Apply** these methods to a real-world problem

## The syllabus is online!

- Course website: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/)
- Syllabus: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/)
- Read it! (and confirm on Canvas)
- Questions? Ask now or later!

## Course organization
### Module 1: introduction
1. Introduction
1. Science of climate hazard
1. Vulnerability, exposure, and impacts
1. Systems

## Course organization
### Module 2: decision analysis
1. Cost-benefit analysis
1. Scenario analysis
1. Policy search and optimization
1. Multiobjective policy search
1. Sequential decision problems

## Course organization
### Module 3: thinking critically
1. Robustness
1. Deep uncertainty
1. Equity and justice

1. Reflections

## Class structure

### Mondays

- Lecture
- Take notes and ask questions
- Slides posted ahead of time on website

## Class structure

### Wednesdays

- Short and easy reading quiz to start
- Student-led reading discussion
- Do the reading and participate in the discussion (including to ask questions!)

## Class structure

### Fridays

- Lab.
- Make significant progress in class.
- Due at the start of next lab.

## Grading

- Weekly reading quizzes (10%)
- Labs (10%)
- Tests (40%)
- Project (30%)
- Reading notes (10%)
- 521 only: reading discussion (10% from tests)

## Acommodations

- If you have a documented disability, please discuss your needs with me
- If you have scheduling conflicts, please let me know as early as possible
- If you need others to wear a mask for your safety, please let me know

## Academic integrity

- AI/ML resource policy in the syllabus
- Rice Honor Code
- If in doubt, ask!

## A community of learning

- We all benefit from a diverse, safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment
- Analysis is not value neutral -- we will discuss how to think critically about the assumptions and values underlying our work, and their implications
- Assume good faith of others and engage in good faith yourself

## Pre-requisites

We will use quantitative language and ideas to frame ideas.
The only formal pre-requisite is a first course in probability / statistics

Exposure to some of the following will be helpful:

- Engineering economics
- Programming
- Climate science
- Engineering design

# Software tools

## Tool overview

In this class, we will use

1. Julia
1. GitHub
1. Quarto
1. VS Code (suggested)

## Why Julia?

::::: {.incremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
- Syntax
    - Readable to computers and humans
    - Closely parallels math notation
- Designed for numerical and scientific computing
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
- Fast! 
    - "Two language problem"
    - All you need is Julia
- Open source
:::
::::

## Julia example

A (naive) implementation of the Fibonacci sequence:

```{julia}
#| echo: true
function fib(n)
    if n < 2
        return n
    else
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
end
fib(10)
```

## GitHub

::: {.incremental}
1. You need a GitHub account
1. Code is stored in "repositories"
1. `clone` a repository to your computer
1. Make changes and `commit` them
1. `push` your changes to GitHub
1. Using GitHub classroom, instructors can view your code
:::

## Quarto

Quarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output

- This website is made with Quarto
- You will use Quarto to create reports for labs
    - Everything in one place
    - No running code, save a figure to `Downloads`, copy into Word, then update your code and try to remember where to paste it
- Reproducible

## VS Code

1. VS Code is a text editor
    1. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead, but I recommend VS Code
1. VS Code can work as a Julia IDE

## Resources

See the [resources page](../resources.qmd) for links to tutorials and other resources!

# Logistics

## Reading

For Wednesday:

- Three news articles on flood risk management
- Come prepared for a discussion on Wednesday
- Reading quiz should be very easy if you do the reading

## Lab 1

- Generally no advance preparation needed
- For our first lab, we will be installing required software for the course.
- Please start working on this lab as soon as possible so that we can use Friday's lab session to troubleshoot any issues and review the material.
