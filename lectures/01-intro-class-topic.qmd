# About the course

## Course goals

Climate risk management is a very broad field.
We will _survey_ how it is implemented in different fields and we will develop a _deep understanding_ of how to develop and assess proposed climate risk management strategies.

## The syllabus is online!

- Course website: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/)
- Syllabus: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/)
- Read it! (and confirm on Canvas)
- Questions? Ask now or later!

## Acommodations

- If you have a documented disability, please discuss your needs with me
- If you have scheduling conflicts, please let me know as early as possible
- If you need others to wear a mask for your safety, please let me know

## Academic integrity

- AI/ML resource policy in the syllabus
- Rice Honor Code
- If in doubt, ask!

## A community of learning

- We all benefit from a diverse, safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment
- Analysis is not value neutral -- we will discuss how to think critically about the assumptions and values underlying our work, and their implications
- Assume good faith of others and engage in good faith yourself

# Software tools

## Tool overview

In this class, we will use

1. Julia
1. GitHub
1. Quarto
1. VS Code (suggested)

## Why Julia?

::::: {.incremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
- Syntax
    - Readable to computers and humans
    - Closely parallels math notation
- Designed for numerical and scientific computing
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
- Fast! 
    - "Two language problem"
    - All you need is Julia
- Open source
:::

## Julia example

A (naive) implementation of the Fibonacci sequence:

```{julia}
#| echo: true
function fib(n)
    if n < 2
        return n
    else
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
end
fib(10)
```

## GitHub

::: {.incremental}
1. You need a GitHub account
1. Code is stored in "repositories"
1. `clone` a repository to your computer
1. Make changes and `commit` them
1. `push` your changes to GitHub
1. Using GitHub classroom, instructors can view your code
:::

## Quarto

Quarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output

- This website is made with Quarto
- You will use Quarto to create reports for labs
    - Everything in one place
    - No running code, save a figure to `Downloads`, copy into Word, then update your code and try to remember where to paste it
- Reproducible

## VS Code

1. VS Code is a text editor
    1. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead, but I recommend VS Code
1. VS Code can work as a Julia IDE

# Logistics

## Reading

For Wednesday:

- Three news articles on flood risk management
- Come prepared for a discussion on Wednesday
- Reading quiz should be very easy if you do the reading

## Lab 1

- Generally no advance preparation needed
- For our first lab, we will be installing required software for the course.
- Please start working on this lab as soon as possible so that we can use Friday's lab session to troubleshoot any issues and review the material.
