I was asked to share the following with you:

> We are looking for people who are concerned by the state of the environment and who want to do something about it. Our yearlong program has prepared recent college graduates for 30 years to launch a career in environmental organizing and advocacy by providing hands-on experience running campaigns with groups like the Wilderness Society, Endangered Species Coalition, Mighty Earth and more. We then connect our graduates to jobs in the environmental and social change movement.

## Today

Moving forward, we'll focus largely on decision frameworks for analyzing climate risks.
We'll generally use *simple systems* for interpretability!
However, many of the same principles apply to *complex systems*.

Today, we'll look at climate risks to complex systems through a case studies.
On Wednesday, we'll read @reed_multisectordynamics:2022 to ground ourselves in the bigger picture.

### Were these temperatures unprecedented?

1. Use observations only
1. Look globally and regionally
1. Past temperatures were lower / comparable

How else can we explore hazard?

## Quick aside: ERA5 reanalysis

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
1. We want data on past weather
1. Observations are unevenly distributed, and come with errors
1. Reanalysis: fills in gaps in observational record, in a way that is consistent in time / physical laws
1. ERA5: a premier reanalysis product

# Demand for heating

**Inferred demand for heating**

1. For each grid cell and each hour, calculate the difference between observed temperature and "comfortable" temperature
1. Take average, weighting by population
::::
:::::

What is the **return period** of temperatures observed during the 2021 Texas freeze as a function of the defined **duration** of the event?

## Some pitfalls

1. The past (1950-2022) may not be a good guide to the future
1. Temperature is not the only factor that influences demand for heating

::: {.fragment}
@lee_ercot:2022 addresses (1) by using a large climate ensemble to explore the distribution of extreme temperatures and (2) by modeling demand as a function of temperature.
:::

## CESM-LE

::: {.incremental}
1. CESM (Community Earth System Model) is one of many widely-used models of global climate
    - "GCM" or "ESM"
1. Uses historical forcing with no data assimilation
    - Thus, "April 11, 1982" in the MODEL will NOT look like "April 11, 1982" in OBSERVATIONS
    - It WILL look like a sample from the distribution of possible weather in mid-Aprils in the 1980s
1. Large ensemble: characterizing distributions needs large $N$ 
:::

## Bias correction

1. Recall: ESMs don't assimilate observations, In general, they will be biased in the distribution of some variable(s).
1. Many methods"
    1. Offset (LD 22)
    1. QQ Mapping
    1. And more complex stuff
1. Many pitfalls!

## CESM-LE Temperatures

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
1. Hottest (coldest) extremes in CESM-LE are hotter (colder) than observations
1. Summer $T$ maxima smoother than winter minima
1. 1-day more extreme than 5-day (duh?)
1. Temps observed in Feb 2021 not that unusual given CESM-LE simulations

# Electricity supply

## Key points

@busby_cascadingrisks:2021:

::: {.incremental}
1. Gas production dropped ~50% 
1. Outages: 30GW of electricity
1. Inadequate winterization of electricity and gas systems
1. Financial repercussions
1. Primary culprit for outages was problems in electricity production from natural gas

## Cascading risks (view thread!)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First, here&#39;s the natural gas supply chain.

## So what?

::: {.incremental}
1. If we wanted to model the natural gas ‚û°Ô∏è electricity supply chain, we would need to know (at minimum!): 
    1. Locations of all wells, separators, gathering lines, compressors, power stations
    1. Weatherization / vulnerability to cold of all
    1. This is very hard!
1. Climate risk to complex systems is hard!
1. Hence, attempts at standardized design rules / standards
:::

# Wrapup

## Policy recommendations

@busby_cascadingrisks:2021, @doss-gollin_txtreme:2021:

1. Regulation and price incentives
1. Plan for winter peaks, not summer ones!
1. Weatherization
1. Demand response
1. Regional transmission

Grid resilience in an electrified, renewable-powered world is possible but non-trivial to ensure

## Summary

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
#### 2021 Texas Cold Snap

1. Cold temperatures: demand for heating üìà
1. Cold temperatures: supply of electricity üìâ
    1. Complex supply chain!
1. Joint effects: cascading failures
:::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
#### How to analyze?

1. Observations/reanalysis: not very many extremes
1. ESMs: bigger sample size, but biased
    - Many pitfalls to bias correction
1. Fragility of individual components ‚û°Ô∏è interdependence ‚û°Ô∏è system performance

## Climate risks to electricity systems

See @doss-gollin_review:2023 for a review:

1. Outages from severe weather
1. At long time scales, technological and demopgrahic drivers of demand dominate
1. At shorter time scales, interannual variability critically important

## Exam Friday

1. Wednesday: half of class time for review session
1. To study: review slides and readings (Julia code will **not** be on the exam)
1. Focus on key concepts and ideas
