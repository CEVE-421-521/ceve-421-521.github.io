## Today

Given some _hazard_, how to we assess the _damages_ or _impacts_?

::: {.fragment}
We can quantify this, for example as
$$
\textrm{Impacts} = \textrm{Vulnerability} \times \textrm{Exposure} \times \textrm{Hazard}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
In other words, we need a **model** of how our **system** responds to a **hazard**, not just the hazard.
Let's understand these terms through some examples!
:::

# Illustrative examples

## Structural fragility curve
$$
p(\textrm{failure}) = f(\textrm{load}, \ldots)
$$

## House depth-damage curve

# Some more complicated examples

## Electricity adequacy

## Industrial resilience

# Some math

## Expectation

The expected value of a function $f(x)$ of a random variable $x$ is:
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) dx
$$
where $p(x)$ is the probability density function of $x$.

::: {.fragment}
In other words, for each possible value of $x$, calculate $f(x)$.
We then take a weighted average, where the weights are the probability of each value of $x$.
:::

## Key insight

You cannot get the expected value of a function by plugging the expected value of the random variable into the function.
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \neq f(\mathbb{E}[x])
$$

## Expected damages

If we want to calculate the **expected damages** then we can use this formula
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) dx
$$
by defining $x$ to be the hazard (e.g., flood depth) and $f(x)$ the damage function.

::: {.callout-important}
The key assumption we need is that we know the probability density function $p(x)$!
:::

## Monte Carlo approximation

In general, $\int f(x) p(x) dx$ is hard to compute analytically.
We can use Monte Carlo methods to approximate this integral.

:::{.callout-important}
Monte Carlo methods are a wide class of computational algorithms for approximating integrals.
:::

## Monte Carlo expectation

If we draw $N$ samples independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a probability distribution $p(x)$, denoted as $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^N$ where $x_i \sim p(x)$, then
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
$$

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip}
Drawing $N$ samples iid from $p(x)$ can be *inefficient*.
Most of the samples will be in regions where $f(x)$ is small, so we are wasting computational effort.
There are many clever ways around this.

:::

## For example: Trapezoidal EAD {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Running regional flood models is computationally expensive.
Often, a model may have been run for a few different nominal **return levels.**
For example, we might have flood depths at each grid for the nominal 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 year floods.

::: {.column width="60%"}

@demoel_reducing:2014 uses trapezoidal methods to approximate the expected annual damages.

## Key points

::: {.incremental}
1. Impacts (damage) depend on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
1. Exposure and vulnerability are changing rapidly.
1. To estimate risk, we need a model for how our system responds to a hazard.
1. If we know the probability density function of the hazard, we can use Monte Carlo methods to estimate expected impacts.
