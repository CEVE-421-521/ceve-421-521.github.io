## Logistics {.scrollable}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Syllabus / lab 0:** sorry for the double assignment (but free points to you)
1. **Lab 1:** about half of you have turned in; looks like the Python problems less severe than anticipated ðŸ˜„; let's troubleshoot after class (email if that doesn't work for you)
1. **Signup:** see [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BfmwCmo63Vh9b3QDuAkpq4Jo_uRSGbKKQqWEDx_kfkw/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up as note taker (421 + 521) and discussion leader (521 only)
1. **Next week:** I'll post readings by Friday.
1. **Good question:** readings on the syllabus are suggestions -- go with what's on the "Readings" page of the website.

## Extra credit opportunity

 I make lots of mistakes!
 If you find one:
 
 1. Create an Issue on the [course repository](https://github.com/CEVE-421-521/ceve-421-521.github.io/) (1 "EC point")
 1. Find the line of code that needs to be fixed and use the permalink function (1 point)
 1. Submit a pull request that fixes it (1 point).
 
 Anything as small as a typo counts, bonus points for bigger mistakes.
 At the end of the semester, we'll scale the EC points so that you get up to 5 "class" points.

## Clarifying questions

We read @seneviratne_wg1ch11:2021 and @lall_ncawater:2018.
What terms or concepts were confusing to you?

::: {.callout-tip}
Please use Canvas discussions (e.g., "Week 2 Reading Discussion") to ask questions about readings.
If you give me heads up, I have a better chance of giving you a satisfactory answer ðŸ˜‰

## Discussion questions
### Two minutes each

Prepare a two minute summary of key points from the "one additional subsection" that you read from @seneviratne_wg1ch11:2021.

## Discussion questions
### Not a concern

Think about one impact of climate change you were surprised to learn about and one hazard that is less of a concern than you thought it was.

## Discussion questions
### Challenges

What are some of the challenges of using climate models to predict future climate?
What are some of the challenges of using climate models to predict future impacts of climate change?

## Discussion questions
### Observations and models

What are some of the challenges of using observations to understand future climate?
What are some of the challenges of using ~~observations~~models to understand future impacts of climate change?

## Discussion questions
### Some additional questions

- Your questions?
- How were did the focus areas of @seneviratne_wg1ch11:2021 and @lall_ncawater:2018 differ?
- What is the difference between **climate risks** and **climate change risks**?
- How should we plan for climate change impacts that are highly uncertain?
