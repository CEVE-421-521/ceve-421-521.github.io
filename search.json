    "section": "A Community of Learning",
    "text": "A Community of Learning\nRice’s core values are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence. Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.\n\nCore Expectations\nCourse success involves a dual responsibility on the part of the instructor and the student.\n\n\nAs the instructor, my responsibility is to provide you with a structure and opportunity to learn. To this end, I commit to:\n\nprovide organized and focused lectures, in-class activities, and assignments;\nencourage students to regularly evaluate and provide feedback on the course;\nmanage the classroom atmosphere to promote learning;\nschedule sufficient out-of-class contact opportunities, such as office hours;\nallow adequate time for assignment completion;\nmake lecture materials, class policies, activities, and assignments accessible to students.\n\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for their own learning in the course and should commit to:\n\nattending all lectures;\ndoing all required preparatory work before class;\nactively participating in online and in-class discussions;\nbeginning assignments and other work early; and\nattending office hours as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nRice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.\nEach of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.\n\n\nAccommodation for Students with Disabilities\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\nAccommodation for Scheduling Conflicts\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements for you.\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are welcome but not required in the classroom. However, if a colleague (student, faculty, or staff) requests that others wear a mask, you are strongly encouraged to make them feel safe. Please do not ask someone making such a request to disclose their underlying medical condition. If for some reason you need your instructor or classmates to wear a mask, please let me know and I will communicate this to the class without disclosing your identity.\nThese policies may change over the course of the semester as the situation evolves.\n\n\nGetting Help\nYou can ask questions through Canvas Discussions and Office Hours. We will make an effort to respond to all Canvas discussion questions within 24 hours, though this won’t always be possible (travel, weekends, etc.). Please do not use email for questions about course content or labs, since other students may have related questions. You should use email for questions about personal matters, such as scheduling conflicts, accommodations, etc."

    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics). All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment).\nIf you are ever unclear about academic integrity, please ask! Additionally, always err on the side of providing more information.)\n\nRice Honor Code\nMore specifically, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nLarge language models (LLMs), like GPT, are powerful tools for generating text that can be used for coding and doing data analysis. This is at once empowering (LLMs are powerful and can save you time) and risky (LLMs can make mistakes that are hard to detect).\nOur general view is that LLMs are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. You are generally permitted to use LLMs in this course, but ultimately, you are responsible for guaranteeing, understanding, and interpreting your results. In particular:\n\nOne of the best applications of LLMs is to write code. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are learning new syntax. However, LLMs can make bad decisions about how to structure your code, can introduce bugs, and can mislead you about what your code is doing. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nLLMs should not be used to generate text that you submit as your own work. If you are assigned a writing assignment, the point is to stimulate your thought process, and you short-cut this if you ask a LLM to generate the response for you. This leads to shallow thinking! However, you may use tools including LLMs (but also Grammarly, spell-check, etc.) to help you edit your writing. This can sometimes be a fine line; it’s always better to ask if you’re not sure, and to disclose your use of these tools in your submission\n\nThe resources page has links to helpful ideas about LLMs and how to use them.\n\n\nPolicy on Web Posting of Course Materials\nUploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material. Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable."

    "section": "Grading",
    "text": "Grading\nYour final grade will be calculated as follow:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPoints (421)\nPoints (521)\n\n\n\n\nReading quizzes\n10\n10\n\n\nLabs\n10\n10\n\n\nTests\n40\n30\n\n\nProject\n30\n30\n\n\nReading Discussion\n0\n10\n\n\nReading Notes\n10\n10\n\n\n\n\nReading Quizzes\nThe purpose of assigning readings is to enhance class discussions. Students who are prepared for class enhance the learning experience for everyone and enable a collaborative group discussion. At the start of classes for which reading was assigned, expect a very short (5 minute) quiz covering basic concepts from the reading. You should be able to get all points on these readings if you have done the reading, even if you found key concepts challenging or confusing.\nYour lowest two reading quizzes will be dropped.\n\n\nLabs\nOn Fridays we will use class time for hands-on programming exercises (“labs”) to give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These labs will be announced on the course website ahead of time so anyone who is able can bring a laptop to class. These labs can be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class for whatever reason, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own assignment for grading. All labs will cover either a set of programming tools or a case study.\nYour lowest two labs will be dropped.\n\n\nTests\nIn-class written exams will be given for each module of the course. Tests are designed to be straightforward and will cover key ideas from reading, as well as key terms and concepts from lecture and code interpretation related to labs.\n\n\nProject\nWe will build a case study related to house elevation over the course of the semester through weekly labs. Answers will be posted for each lab, so mistakes made in one lab do not pass to the next.\nFor a final project, you will be asked to incorporate additional concept(s) from the course into the case study. For example, you might improve the representation of additional sources of uncertainty, use a more sophisticated optimization algorithm, or change the objectives of the optimization problem.\nStudents enrolled in the 421 section (i.e., undergraduates) may work in small groups. Students enrolled in the 521 section (i.e., graduate students) must work individually.\n\n\nReading Discussion\nAll students enrolled in the 521 section (i.e., graduate students) will present one of the papers assigned to the class and lead a discussion.\n\nThis discussion should take 30-50 minutes.\nYou should sign up for a time by the second week of class.\nYou should meet with your instructor at least one week before your presentation to discuss the reading and your discussion plan.\n\nYou will be graded on the quality of your presentation, the depth of your understanding of the reading, and your ability to lead a discussion.\nStudents enrolled in the 421 section may choose to present a paper alone or in a group. If you choose to present a paper, you will be graded on the same scale as the 521 students.\n\n\nReading Notes\nAll students will act as “note-taker” for an in-class reading discussion. The note-taker will be responsible for taking notes on the discussion (following up from the recording as necessary), then adding them to the course website (through a Pull Request; guidance will be provided). These notes should summarize, rather than transcribe, the discussion, and identify key insights, questions, disagreements, and points of confusion.\nYou should sign up for a time by the second week of class. Groups may be permitted depending on enrollment.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nLate projects will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day. Specifically, your grade will be multiplied \\(0.9^d\\) where \\(d\\) is the number of days late. Late labs will not be accepted so that solutions can be posted promptly.\nAs described above, your lowest two labs and reading quizzes will be dropped. This is intended to accommodate events like minor illnesses, travel to a conference, and other circumstances that may cause you to miss a lab or quiz. If a major circumstance arises (e.g., a death in the family, a serious illness, etc.) that causes you to miss an extended period of time, please contact the instructor to discuss accommodations."

    "text": "Toolkit: overview\nGetting set up for this course requires the following steps. If you are an experienced programmer, you are free to follow your own workflow to set up these tools. You will absolutely need Quarto, GitHub, and Julia. If you are not an experienced programmer, the following steps are not the only way to get these tools set up, but they are a very good way.\nIf you install course tools using steps other than the ones provided on this page, be aware that your instructors may be able to provide you with only limited support.\n\nJulia\nWe’re using the Julia programming language in this course. Julia is a fast, modern, open-source programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing.\nWe’re using it for a few key reasons. First, the syntax is human-readable and closely parallels math notation, which reduces the cognitive burden of translating between conceptual and computational models. Second, it’s fast, which means that Julia solves the “two language problem”: you don’t need to learn C or Fortran to dig under the hood and write fast code. Other great features include that it’s open-source, which makes it reproducible and shareable, and it has a fantastic package manager.\nThere are some great resources out there about why Julia is great. See posts by Julia Data Science or the Julia Creators (with followup).\n\n\nGitHub\ngit is a software tool for version control that keeps track of changes to files over time. GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories and provides a web interface for interacting with them.\nTo use GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub account. Code on GitHub is stored in repositories. A simple workflow is to clone a repository to your computer, make changes, commit them, then push your changes to GitHub.\nWe will also use GitHub classroom, which allows instructors to share templates and view your code.\n\n\nQuarto\nQuarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output. For example, this website is made with Quarto! You will use Quarto to create reports for labs. This lets you keep everything in one place – no more running code, saving a figure to Downloads, copying into Word, then trying to remember where to paste the figure when you update the code.\n\n\nVS Code\nVS Code is a text editor. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead. However, VS Code is very nearly an officially supported IDE for Julia."

    "title": "Lab 01: Software Installation",
    "section": "Installing software",
    "text": "Installing software\n\nInstall Julia\nThe best way to install Julia is through the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\nIf you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.9 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njulia add 1.9.4\njulia default 1.9.4\nThis will install Julia 1.9.4 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\nInstall VS Code\nVS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nYou can skip this section if you are an experienced programmer and already have a preferred IDE. Your IDE will likely have instructions for Julia and QUarto setup.\n\nYou can download it here; open the downloaded file to install. Make sure to select the correct version for your operating system. If you have a newish Apple mac (with M1, M2, or M3 chip), make sure to check whether you have an Intel or Apple chip before choosing which version to download. You can also use homebrew or your preferred package manager to install VS Code.\n\nVS Code Julia Extension\nLike many editors, VS Code is a modular system that can be extended with plugins. We will install the Julia extension, which will allow us to run Julia code and interact with the Julia REPL from within VS Code (we’ll add the Quarto extension later).\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View.\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; reach out if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create .jl and .qmd files to write Julia code and execute line by line.\n\n\n\nGitHub\nSee GitHub official tutorials for more helpful resources and tutorials.\n\nCreate GitHub Account\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account. Otherwise, create an account. It doesn’t have to be linked to your Rice email or your NetID.\nFor labs and projects, you should use the GitHub Classroom link posted on Canvas to “accept” the assignment, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.\n\n\nGitHub Desktop (Optional)\nYou can do everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code. The GitHub desktop app is also great, or alternatively you may work directly through the terminal if you have prior experience.\n\n\nInstall Git\ngit is a version control software that powers GitHub under the hood (git is the version control software, GitHub is an online platform). Based on past experience with the course, you probably already have git installed! If you’re not sure if it’s installed, see instructions here.\n\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nQuarto combines the best of Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown to create a document format that is ideal for conducting and communicating data science. We will use Quarto to create and share our work in this course; this website is also built using Quarto.||\nFollow the documentation to install Quarto. Be sure to ensure that you have the right version for your operating system.\n\nInstall the Quarto Extension for VS Code\nUnder “Step 2”, click on the VS Code icon.\n\n\nInstall Jupyter\nUnder the hood, Quarto uses Jupyter to run code. You don’t need to know how Jupyter works or worry about it, because it runs under the hood, but we will need to install it. Jupyter is a Python package.\nIf you don’t have Python installed (if you’re not sure, you should install Miniconda below), you’ll need to install it. The best way, by far, is to install Miniconda (see Conda documentation).\nOnce you have Python installed, you can open your Terminal (open VS Code then open the terminal), then run\npython3 -m pip install jupyter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on past experience, getting Jupyter installed and Quarto to find your Jupyter installation is the most common source of problems, especially on Windows machines. Please start this early so you have a full week to get help if you need it."

These will ensure that your installation is working smoothly!\n\nFollow the link to lab 1 assignment from Canvas (it should start with classroom.github.com). You will get a message saying ” Your assignment repository has been created: …“. Click on the link to go to your repository.\nclone the repository for lab 01 (use the Github Classroom link from Canvas) to your computer. You can use VS Code functionality, GitHub Desktop, or your terminal.\nOpen the directory containing the repository in VS Code doing one of the following:\n\nFrom GitHub desktop: Repository &gt; Open in Visual Studio Code\nIn VS Code: File &gt; Open Folder...\n\nOpen the index.qmd file in VS Code and replace the author: CEVE 421/521 line with your name and netID\nOpen the JULIA Repl\n\nOpen the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)\nStart typing “Julia: Start REPL”. It will auto-complete; select the command as it appears.\n\nSet up your project environment.\n\nIn the Julia REPL, type ] to enter the package manager. It should now show something like (lab-01) pkg&gt;.\nType instantiate and run it (Enter). This will install all the packages needed for this lab.\nType the backspace key to exit the package manager.\n\nEdit the index.qmd file to add your name and netID\nRender the document\n\nOpen the solutions.qmd file\nOpen the command palette and run “Quarto: Preview”. After some activity, a preview of the rendered document should open in VS Code. If you see something like Browse at http://localhost:4200/index.html you can open that link in your web browser to see the rendered document.\nCheck the box on line 46 or 47 of the solutions.qmd file to indicate that you were able to render the document. If you were unable to render the document, check the other box and seek help. Make sure the box check renders correctly in the preview.\nRender to PDF or Microsoft Word following the directions below.\n\nIf you’re still having trouble:\n\nTry running build IJulia in the Julia REPL’s Pkg mode (type ])\nCome to office hours\nPost on the Canvas discussion for Lab 1\n\ncommit and push your changes to GitHub\nSubmit your rendered .docx or .pdf file to Canvas\n\n\nRunning Code\nWe can use Quarto to run Julia code in-line\n\nprintln(\"I'm using Julia!\")\n\nI'm using Julia!\n\n\nWe can also load packages\n\nusing CairoMakie\nusing LaTeXStrings\n\nand use them to make plots\n\nf = Figure()\nax = Axis(f[1, 1]; title=L\"$y = \\sin(x)$\", xlabel=L\"$x$\", ylabel=L\"$y$\")\nx = range(0, 10; length=100)\ny = sin.(x)\nlines!(ax, x, y)\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering the Document\nA Quarto document is a plain text file that uses a simple code language to embed text, math, code, and the code’s output. You can run the document line by line, or you can render to a variety of formats. This is helpful for sharing with others, or for creating a final document for yourself.\nWe will check our ability to\n\nPreview the document in HTML (a web-native format)\nRender the document to PDF or Microsoft Word (a portable, shareable, and printable format)\n\n\nHTML\nFirst, verify that you can preview the document in HTML:\n\nOpen the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)\nType “Quarto: Preview”\n\n\n\nPDF\nYou can use Quarto to generate PDF documents.

    "text": "Course Information\nClimate variability and change pose threats to lives and livelihoods. These climate risks can be managed through the design and operation of infrastructure systems, as well as through disaster response and recovery. Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty.\nIn this course, you will learn climate science, uncertainty quantification, and decision analysis methods to support climate risk management. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover both methods and applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets. Active class participation is required. Methods covered include scenario analysis, exploratory modeling, cost-benefit analysis, single- and multi-objective policy search, reinforcement learning, deep uncertainty, robust decision making, and equitable decision making.\nFor additional information, see the syllabus."
