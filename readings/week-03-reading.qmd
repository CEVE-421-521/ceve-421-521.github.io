Please read @wing_vulnerability:2020 for Wednesday's class.
As you read, please post any clarifying questions you have to Canvas.

This paper analyzes insurance claims data to evaluate and explore "depth-damage" curves.
Please consider the following questions as you read:

- What is the difference between a probabilistic and deterministic depth-damage curve? What are practical advantages of a probabilistic depth-damage curve?
- If you were predicting flood damages for a structure, what information besides flood depth might be useful?
- What might explain the regional patterns of depth-damage curves in the paper?
- What are some problems with using insurance claims data to develop or validate depth-damage curves?

Please also prepare a discussion question for class based on this paper.
