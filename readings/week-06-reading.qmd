## Discussion Questions

- For these 2 questions, be ready to share 1-2 sentences for each of them by writing them on the
whiteboard at the front at the beginning of the discussion.
    - What is the main idea of this paper?
    - Why did the author write this paper?
- The author outlines 2 main types of modeling (consolidative and exploratory). Be ready to
discuss the key differences of both of these main approaches.
- The author uses a consolidative modeling example of the "ultimate combat model" to illustrate
the main issues with consolidative models.
    - What are some of the problems?
    - Are there ways to avoid these problems in consolidative modeling?
- What are the uses of exploratory modeling, according to this paper? (so what?)
- What do we do with the uncertainty we discovered in our model?
    - i.e. what is the role of sensitivity analysis? If we find the bounds in our model, then
what?
    - Follow up: how would we use model uncertainty for our case study on building
elevations?
- The author discusses a hierarchy of exploratory modeling types (data-driven, question-driven,
model-driven). Letâ€™s talk about the goals of each of them and how that may lead to differences in
our modeling approach.
